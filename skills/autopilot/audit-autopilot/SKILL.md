name: audit-autopilot
description: Post-hoc audit of autopilot execution fidelity. Analyzes OpenCode session traces to evaluate how faithfully the autopilot workflow executed against its contract, surfacing errors, friction, and drift with traceable evidence anchors. Use when the user wants to audit an autopilot run, analyze session quality, check if autopilot did what it was supposed to, or provides a session ID from an autopilot execution.

# Audit Autopilot

Audit an autopilot execution by analyzing its OpenCode session trace. The audit evaluates three layers of fidelity, producing a structured scorecard with evidence anchors back to the raw session data.

## When to use

Run after an `/autopilot` session completes. User provides the orchestrator session ID (find it with `TODO: reasonix session export — TBD`). Do not use for non-autopilot sessions.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Gather inputs

The session ID may come from the command argument (`/audit-autopilot <session-id>`) or be stated directly in the user's prompt. If already provided, skip asking and proceed.

If not provided, ask the user for:
- **Orchestrator session ID** (required) — the session where `/autopilot` was invoked
- **Project directory** (optional, defaults to cwd) — where `.scratch/` issues and contracts live

If the user doesn't know the session ID, help them find it:
```bash
TODO: reasonix session list — TBD
```
Look for sessions with titles matching autopilot invocations or issue names.

If the user has already specified subagent session IDs or contract file paths, use them directly rather than re-discovering them.

### Step 1: Export and parse sessions

Export the orchestrator session:
```bash
TODO: reasonix session export — TBD
```

Parse this JSON to extract key metadata:
- **Issue sources**: Find paths like `.scratch/<feature>/issues/<NN-slug>/` or GitHub issue numbers in the user's initial messages
- **Subagent session IDs**: Scan all `task` tool calls — each one has `state.metadata.sessionId` giving the child session ID. Track which session mapped to which agent type (implementer / reviewer) and round number
- **Contract files**: From the orchestrator's dispatch prompts, locate `AGENT-BRIEF.md` and `issue.md` paths

For GitHub issues, the contract is embedded in the orchestrator's prompt text — extract it directly.

**If the user already specified subagent session IDs**, skip the discovery step and use the provided IDs directly. Export each subagent session:
```bash
TODO: reasonix session export — TBD
```

### Step 2: Load contracts

**If contract paths were provided by the user**, read them directly.

Otherwise, read the contract documents for every issue involved in the autopilot run:
- `<issue_dir>/AGENT-BRIEF.md` — Acceptance Criteria, Out of scope
- `<issue_dir>/issue.md` — Original problem description, intent

For GitHub issues, extract the AC and scope from the orchestrator's dispatch prompt.

### Step 3: Phase 1 — Lightweight analysis + mandatory spot-checks

Answer the 9 analysis questions (see [references/questions.md](references/questions.md)) using primarily the orchestrator session trace and contract documents. Each question gets one of three scores: **PASS**, **WARN**, or **FAIL**.

For every question, first check the orchestrator-level evidence (reports, verdicts, orchestrator actions). Then **always perform spot-checks** on subagent sessions — even when the orchestrator-level analysis suggests no issue. Spot-check strategy:

- **Layer 1 (Fidelity)**: For each issue, sample 1-2 rounds of implementer sessions. Search for test execution tool calls (bash/pytest/vitest/etc.) matching the AC descriptions. If none found, this is a signal even if reports claim DONE.
- **Layer 2 (Errors)**: Cross-reference reviewer VERDICT changes across rounds. If reviewer gave RETRY with 3 Criticals in round 0 and MERGE in round 1, spot-check round 1's implementer session for evidence those Criticals were actually fixed.
- **Layer 3 (Friction & Drift)**: Compare round 0 vs round N implementer sessions for scope expansion — are later rounds touching files not in the original AC?

Spot-checks are lightweight: search for specific patterns (test runs, file edits, tool call sequences) rather than reading the full session trace. One spot-check per layer per issue is sufficient.

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| PASS | No issue found; evidence supports correct behavior |
| WARN | Suspicious but inconclusive; requires Phase 2 deep-dive |
| FAIL | Clear defect confirmed; evidence anchor provided |

Every WARN and FAIL must include an **evidence anchor**: the session, message ID, and a brief excerpt from the trace.

See [references/questions.md](references/questions.md) for the full question list, scoring rubric per question, and evidence requirements.

### Step 4: Phase 2 — Deep-dive

If **any** question scored WARN or FAIL in Phase 1, Phase 2 is mandatory. Otherwise skip to Step 5 (all green — clean audit).

For each flagged question, load the relevant subagent session(s) in full and perform targeted analysis:

- **WARN → confirm or clear**: Search the full subagent trace for confirming or refuting evidence. Update the score to PASS or FAIL with the new evidence.
- **FAIL → root cause**: Trace the failure backward through the session to find the originating moment (e.g., a skipped test, a misread AC, a premature report). Document the chain of causation.

Phase 2 reads subagent sessions selectively — only the sessions relevant to the flagged questions, not all sessions indiscriminately.

### Step 5: Produce scorecard

Output the audit report using the template from [references/report-template.md](references/report-template.md). The report must include:

1. **Executive summary**: Overall fidelity percentage (PASS count ÷ 9), issue count, round count, verdict summary
2. **Scorecard**: 3×3 table with scores and one-line rationale per question
3. **Findings**: Detailed breakdown of every FAIL and WARN, with evidence anchors, severity, and root cause analysis (from Phase 2)
4. **Recommendations**: Concrete, actionable suggestions for improving either the autopilot configuration (agent prompts, command logic) or the contracts (AGENT-BRIEF clarity, AC specificity)

## Principles

- **Evidence over opinion**: Never claim a defect without citing a specific message ID and excerpt from the session trace
- **Spot-check always**: A clean orchestrator-level report does not guarantee clean subagent behavior
- **Deep-dive selectively**: Don't read every subagent session in full — follow the signals from Phase 1
- **Report for humans**: The audit is for a developer to read and act on, not for automated pipelines
