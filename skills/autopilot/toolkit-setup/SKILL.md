# Toolkit Setup

Orchestrate the end-to-end install-or-update workflow for autopilot-toolkit. Runs inside the project repo; requires `PROJECT_ROOT` set to the repo root.

## Input Parameter

```
--target reasonix|codex|kimi   (default: reasonix)
```

The `--target` parameter selects the target runtime. All skills are installed into the appropriate directories based on their category (see Step 1b). Principles are always installed to the shared `~/.agents/principles/` regardless of target. Kimi has no agent-exclusive skill directory — its coupled variants install to the shared `~/.agents/skills/` alongside agnostic skills.

## Scope

This setup manages **only** autopilot-toolkit's own skills — derived from `.skill-lock.json` (upstream) and `skills/autopilot/*/` (autopilot). It does not inspect or modify other projects' skills that may coexist in the install directories.

## Step 1: Discover Expected Set

Derive the authoritative expected set from two sources — no hardcoded list.

### Upstream skills (from `.skill-lock.json`)

Read `$PROJECT_ROOT/.skill-lock.json`, parse the `skills` object keys. Each key is an upstream skill name. Extract the `skillPath` for each — it gives the relative path (e.g. `skills/engineering/tdd/SKILL.md`). Construct the expected source dir as:

```
$PROJECT_ROOT/skills/upstream/<skillPath directory>
```

(install.rs uses the same pattern: `$PROJECT_ROOT/skills/upstream/$skill_path` then `dirname`.)

Use python3 for JSON parsing if available:

```bash
python3 -c "
import json, os
with open('$PROJECT_ROOT/.skill-lock.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
for name, info in data.get('skills', {}).items():
    skill_path = info['skillPath']
    src_dir = os.path.join('$PROJECT_ROOT', 'skills/upstream', os.path.dirname(skill_path))
    print(f'{name}|{src_dir}')
"
```

If python3 is not available, fall back to grep-based extraction (less reliable but functional).

### Autopilot skills (from filesystem)

Scan `$PROJECT_ROOT/skills/autopilot/*/`. A directory is a skill if it contains either:
- `SKILL.md` directly (agnostic skill, e.g. `toolkit-setup`, `zoom-out`)
- `reasonix/SKILL.md` (runtime-coupled skill with per-runtime variants)

```bash
for skill_dir in "$PROJECT_ROOT"/skills/autopilot/*/; do
  if [ -f "$skill_dir/SKILL.md" ] || [ -f "$skill_dir/reasonix/SKILL.md" ]; then
    name="$(basename "$skill_dir")"
    abs_dir="$(cd "$skill_dir" && pwd)"
    echo "$name|$abs_dir"
  fi
done
```

### Combined

Union these into a single expected set: `{name → expected_source_dir}`. The expected count is derived dynamically — do not hardcode a number.

## Step 1b: Categorize Skills

For each skill in the expected set, determine its category:

```bash
categorize_skill() {
  local src="$1"
  if [ -f "$src/reasonix/SKILL.md" ]; then
    echo "coupled"   # Has per-runtime variants (reasonix/codex subdirectories)
  else
    echo "agnostic"   # No runtime variants — works on any agent
  fi
}
```

Categories:

| Category | Detection | Skills (conceptual) |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **agnostic** | `SKILL.md` directly in source dir | All upstream skills + `toolkit-setup` + `zoom-out` |
| **coupled** | `reasonix/SKILL.md` exists | The 4 workflow skills: `audit-autopilot`, `autopilot-implementer`, `autopilot-orchestrator`, `autopilot-reviewer` |

Runtime-agnostic skills go to the shared directory (`~/.agents/skills/`). Runtime-coupled skills go to the agent-exclusive directory for the target runtime (`~/.reasonix/skills/` or `~/.codex/skills/`) only when that target has a loadable `SKILL.md` variant — **except Kimi**, whose coupled variants install to the shared directory (`~/.agents/skills/`) via `--shared`, since Kimi Code scans the shared directory and has no agent-exclusive one.

For `--target codex`, `autopilot-implementer` and `autopilot-reviewer` are custom agents only. Their `codex/` directories contain `agent.toml` without `SKILL.md`, so do not sync them into `~/.codex/skills/`; sync their TOML files via `install.rs sync --target codex --agent` instead.

### Also: Codex custom agents

For `--target codex`, coupled skills may have `.toml` agent definition files in their `codex/` subdirectory. Check:

```bash
has_codex_agents() {
  local src="$1"
  [ -d "$src/codex" ] && ls "$src/codex"/*.toml >/dev/null 2>&1
}
```

If `.toml` files exist, they will be synced to `~/.codex/agents/<name>.toml` via `install.rs sync --target codex --agent`.

## Step 2: Diagnose

### 2a. Determine target directories

```bash
TARGET="${1:-reasonix}"   # --target reasonix|codex|kimi, default reasonix

# Shared skills directory (always ~/.agents/skills/)
SHARED_DIR="${AGENTS_SKILLS_DIR:-$HOME/.agents/skills}"

# Agent-exclusive skills directory (kimi has none — coupled variants use SHARED_DIR)
if [ "$TARGET" = "codex" ]; then
  TARGET_DIR="${CODEX_SKILLS_DIR:-$HOME/.codex/skills}"
  CODEX_AGENTS_DIR="${CODEX_AGENTS_DIR:-$HOME/.codex/agents}"
elif [ "$TARGET" = "kimi" ]; then
  TARGET_DIR="$SHARED_DIR"
else
  TARGET_DIR="${REASONIX_SKILLS_DIR:-$HOME/.reasonix/skills}"
fi

# Principles directory (always shared)
PRINCIPLES_DIR="${AGENTS_PRINCIPLES_DIR:-$HOME/.agents/principles}"
```

### 2b. Check skills directories exist

```bash
ls -d "$SHARED_DIR" 2>/dev/null || true
ls -d "$TARGET_DIR" 2>/dev/null || true
```

If a directory does not exist, it will be created by `install.rs sync` on first use. Proceed — do not stop.

### 2c. Diagnose each expected skill

For each name in the expected set, determine the correct install directory and expected source path based on category:

- **Agnostic**: install to `$SHARED_DIR/<name>`, expected source = `<skill_source_dir>`
- **Coupled with target `SKILL.md`**: install to `$TARGET_DIR/<name>` (for kimi, `$TARGET_DIR` IS `$SHARED_DIR`), expected source = `<skill_source_dir>/<target>` (i.e. `reasonix/`, `codex/`, or `kimi/` variant)
- **Coupled without target `SKILL.md`**: skip skill-state diagnosis for `$TARGET_DIR/<name>`; this is valid for Codex custom-agent-only variants and for coupled skills that have no kimi variant yet

```bash
check_skill_state() {
  local name="$1" expected_src="$2" skills_dir="$3"
  local target="$skills_dir/$name"

  if [ ! -e "$target" ] && [ ! -L "$target" ]; then
    echo "missing"
    return
  fi

  if [ -e "$target" ] && [ ! -L "$target" ]; then
    echo "real_dir"
    return
  fi

  # It's a symlink
  local link_target
  link_target="$(readlink "$target" 2>/dev/null || true)"

  if [ "$link_target" != "$expected_src" ]; then
    echo "wrong_target"
    return
  fi

  if [ ! -d "$target" ]; then
    echo "broken"
    return
  fi

  echo "correct"
}
```

States:
- **correct** — symlink exists, target matches expected, target is a valid directory
- **missing** — no entry at the name
- **wrong_target** — symlink points to a different path than expected
- **broken** — symlink exists but its target is not a valid directory (dangling)
- **real_dir** — a real (non-symlink) directory occupies the name

### 2d. Diagnose codex agents (codex target only)

For `--target codex`, also check if `autopilot-implementer` and `autopilot-reviewer` have `.toml` agent files in their source's `codex/` directory. If present, treat them like symlinked skills: check whether `$CODEX_AGENTS_DIR/<name>.toml` is a symlink pointing to the expected source `<skill_source_dir>/codex/agent.toml`. Use the same five states as skill diagnosis (correct / missing / wrong_target / broken / real_file). By default, `$CODEX_AGENTS_DIR` is `~/.codex/agents`.

### 2e. Find orphaned symlinks

Orphaned symlinks: entries in either `$SHARED_DIR` or `$TARGET_DIR` that are symlinks pointing under `PROJECT_ROOT` but whose names are NOT expected for that install directory. These are leftovers from removed skills or from older routing rules.

Use directory-specific expected names:

- `$SHARED_DIR`: agnostic skill names, **plus coupled skill names that have a `kimi/SKILL.md` variant** (kimi variants are legitimate shared-dir residents for every target — never orphan them)
- `$TARGET_DIR` (skipped for kimi, where `$TARGET_DIR` = `$SHARED_DIR`): coupled skill names whose `<skill_source_dir>/<target>/SKILL.md` exists only

Check BOTH directories:

```bash
find_orphans() {
  local dir="$1"
  [ -d "$dir" ] || return
  for entry in "$dir"/*/; do
    [ -d "$entry" ] || continue
    name="$(basename "$entry")"
    [ -L "$dir/$name" ] || continue

    # Check if name is in expected set
    in_expected=false
    for ename in $EXPECTED_NAMES; do
      [ "$ename" = "$name" ] && in_expected=true && break
    done
    if [ "$in_expected" = true ]; then continue; fi

    link_target="$(readlink "$dir/$name" 2>/dev/null || true)"
    case "$link_target" in
      "$PROJECT_ROOT"|"$PROJECT_ROOT/"*)
        echo "$name|$dir"  # orphaned: name and which directory
        ;;
    esac
  done
}

find_orphans "$SHARED_DIR"
# Skipped for kimi — TARGET_DIR is SHARED_DIR, already scanned above
[ "$TARGET" != "kimi" ] && find_orphans "$TARGET_DIR"
```

## Step 3: Execute

Use `install.rs` subcommands with the appropriate flags. See `install.rs --help` for full reference.

### Actions by state (per category)

For **agnostic** skills — use `--shared` flag to install to the shared directory:

| State | Action | Command |
|-------|--------|---------|
| missing | Create symlink | `install.rs sync <name> <src> --shared` |
| broken | Remove broken + recreate | `install.rs sync <name> <src> --shared` |
| wrong_target | Replace with correct target | `install.rs sync <name> <src> --shared` |
| real_dir | **WARN** — do NOT touch | Report conflict, skip |
| correct | No-op | — |

For **coupled** skills — first check whether the target variant is a loadable skill:

```bash
variant_src="$src/$target"
if [ ! -f "$variant_src/SKILL.md" ]; then
  # Codex agent-only variants, such as autopilot-implementer/codex/agent.toml,
  # are not skills. Skip sync; still deploy agent TOMLs below.
  skip_skill_sync=true
fi
```

When `SKILL.md` exists, the sync command depends on the target. For `reasonix`/`codex` use `--target`; for `kimi` use `--shared` (Kimi variants live in the shared directory):

| State | Action | Command (reasonix/codex) | Command (kimi) |
|-------|--------|--------------------------|----------------|
| missing | Create symlink | `install.rs sync <name> <src>/<target> --target <target>` | `install.rs sync <name> <src>/kimi --shared` |
| broken | Remove broken + recreate | same as missing | same as missing |
| wrong_target | Replace with correct target | same as missing | same as missing |
| real_dir | **WARN** — do NOT touch | Report conflict, skip | Report conflict, skip |
| correct | No-op | — | — |

Where `<target>` is `reasonix` or `codex`, and `<src>/<target>` is the variant source directory (e.g. `skills/autopilot/audit-autopilot/codex`). Do not run `install.rs sync` for a variant directory that lacks `SKILL.md` (e.g. Codex agent-only variants, or coupled skills without a `kimi/` variant on a kimi run).

### Codex custom agents

For `--target codex`, if a coupled skill has `.toml` agent files in its `codex/` subdirectory, sync each as a file symlink (not a copy — `install.rs sync --agent` uses symlinks like skills do):

```bash
install.rs sync <agent_name> <skill_source_dir>/codex/agent.toml --target codex --agent
```

This creates/repairs a file symlink `~/.codex/agents/<agent_name>.toml` → `<skill_source_dir>/codex/agent.toml`. Behaviour mirrors skill sync: creates if missing, replaces if broken/wrong, warns on real-file conflict. Symlinks ensure source updates take effect immediately without re-running setup.

Agent names are derived from the parent skill directory name (e.g. `skills/autopilot/autopilot-implementer/codex/agent.toml` -> agent name `autopilot-implementer`).

### Orphaned symlinks

For each orphaned symlink found in Step 2e, remove it from the appropriate directory:

```bash
# Agnostic orphan (in shared dir):
install.rs unlink <name> --shared

# Coupled orphan (in target dir):
install.rs unlink <name> --target <target>
```

This removes the symlink only if its target lies under PROJECT_ROOT (safe).

### Link principles

Ensure principles symlink (unchanged — always goes to shared location):

```bash
install.rs link-principles "$PROJECT_ROOT/principles"
```

This creates/repairs `~/.agents/principles` → `$PROJECT_ROOT/principles`. Behaviour mirrors sync: creates if missing, replaces if broken/wrong, warns on real-dir conflict.

### Execution order

1. Process all expected agnostic skills (sync to `$SHARED_DIR`)
2. Process all expected coupled skills (sync to `$TARGET_DIR`)
3. If codex target: sync agent `.toml` files for implementer/reviewer via `sync --target codex --agent`
4. Clean up orphaned symlinks from BOTH directories (unlink)
5. Ensure principles symlink (link-principles)

Track each action taken — the report must list specific skill names, operations, and flags used.

## Step 4: Verify

Re-run Step 2c diagnosis on all expected skills. Every skill should now be `correct`.

For codex target, also verify that `$CODEX_AGENTS_DIR/<name>.toml` is a symlink pointing to the expected source file for implementer and reviewer (if they had `.toml` sources). Use `readlink` to verify the symlink target matches. By default, `$CODEX_AGENTS_DIR` is `~/.codex/agents`.

Verify principles symlink:

```bash
[ -L "$PRINCIPLES_DIR" ] && [ "$(readlink "$PRINCIPLES_DIR")" = "$PROJECT_ROOT/principles" ] && [ -d "$PRINCIPLES_DIR" ]
```

### Directory layout verification

After a successful setup, the expected directory layout per target:

**`--target reasonix`:**
```
~/.agents/skills/           # Agnostic skills (shared)
├── diagnosing-bugs → .../skills/upstream/skills/engineering/diagnosing-bugs
├── tdd → .../skills/upstream/skills/engineering/tdd
├── ... (all upstream skills)
├── toolkit-setup → .../skills/autopilot/toolkit-setup
├── zoom-out → .../skills/autopilot/zoom-out

~/.reasonix/skills/         # Coupled skills (reasonix variants)
├── audit-autopilot → .../skills/autopilot/audit-autopilot/reasonix
├── autopilot-implementer → .../skills/autopilot/autopilot-implementer/reasonix
├── autopilot-orchestrator → .../skills/autopilot/autopilot-orchestrator/reasonix
├── autopilot-reviewer → .../skills/autopilot/autopilot-reviewer/reasonix

~/.agents/principles → $PROJECT_ROOT/principles
```

**`--target codex`:**
```
~/.agents/skills/           # Agnostic skills (shared)
├── ... (same as reasonix)

~/.codex/skills/            # Coupled skills (codex variants)
├── audit-autopilot → .../skills/autopilot/audit-autopilot/codex
├── autopilot-orchestrator → .../skills/autopilot/autopilot-orchestrator/codex

~/.codex/agents/            # Codex custom agents (symlinked, not copied)
├── autopilot-implementer.toml → .../autopilot-implementer/codex/agent.toml
├── autopilot-reviewer.toml → .../autopilot-reviewer/codex/agent.toml

~/.agents/principles → $PROJECT_ROOT/principles
```

**`--target kimi`:**
```
~/.agents/skills/           # Agnostic skills AND kimi coupled variants (shared)
├── ... (all agnostic skills, same as reasonix)
├── autopilot-implementer → .../skills/autopilot/autopilot-implementer/kimi
├── autopilot-orchestrator → .../skills/autopilot/autopilot-orchestrator/kimi
├── autopilot-reviewer → .../skills/autopilot/autopilot-reviewer/kimi

~/.agents/principles → $PROJECT_ROOT/principles
```

Note: `~/.codex/skills/` and `~/.reasonix/skills/` are **agent-exclusive** — only the target runtime scans them. This prevents the Reasonix variant of a coupled skill from being discovered by Codex and vice versa.

## Report Template

Output a structured report — list specific skill names, operations, and flags used.

```
TOOLKIT_SETUP_REPORT:
Target: reasonix | codex | kimi

## Expected Set
  N skills (K upstream + A autopilot)
  Agnostic: N  Coupled: M

## Actions Taken
  SYNC <name> → <src> (shared)
  SYNC <name> → <variant_src> (--target reasonix)
  SYNC <name> → <src> (--target codex --agent)
  UNLINK <name> (orphaned, shared)
  UNLINK <name> (orphaned, --target codex)
  LINK-PRINCIPLES → <src>
  — or —
  (none — all skills already correct)

## Warnings
  WARN: <name> is a real directory at <path> — skipping
  — or —
  (none)

## Verification
  [PASS] <name>
  [PASS] <name>
  ...
  [PASS] principles
  Total: N expected, 0 missing, 0 damaged
  ALL PASS
```

If any skill remains missing/broken/wrong_target after execute, report as FAIL and do NOT output ALL PASS.

## Edge Cases

- **Skills directory missing**: Created automatically by `install.rs sync` on first use.
- **Variant source directory missing**: Report as WARN and skip sync. Do not call `install.rs sync` for a missing target variant.
- **Codex variant has no SKILL.md**: The `codex/` subdirectory may contain only `.toml` agent files. Skip skill sync explicitly; still sync agents via `sync --target codex --agent`. If a stale toolkit-owned symlink for that name exists in `~/.codex/skills/`, unlink it as an invalid target skill entry.
- **Real file conflict (agents)**: A real (non-symlink) file at `~/.codex/agents/<name>.toml`. Reported as WARN. install.rs refuses to overwrite real files. User must remove manually before sync can replace it with a symlink.
- **Real directory conflict**: Reported as WARN. install.rs refuses to overwrite real directories. User must resolve manually.
- **No changes needed**: Report "all skills already correct", ALL PASS.
- **python3 unavailable**: Fall back to grep-based parsing of `.skill-lock.json`. Less robust but functional for standard JSON layouts.
- **Empty .skill-lock.json skills**: Only autopilot skills in expected set. Valid scenario for minimal installs.
- **No `--target` argument**: Defaults to `reasonix`. The skill body should treat missing/empty `--target` as `reasonix`.
- **Multiple targets on same machine**: Running `--target reasonix`, `--target codex`, and `--target kimi` on the same machine is supported and they coexist. Agnostic skills are shared (installed once); reasonix/codex coupled skills go to separate agent-exclusive directories; kimi coupled variants live in the shared directory and are recognized as expected residents there by every target's orphan scan.
- **Kimi variant missing for a coupled skill**: Skip sync for that skill (same rule as Codex agent-only variants). A coupled skill without `kimi/SKILL.md` is simply not installed on a kimi run.
